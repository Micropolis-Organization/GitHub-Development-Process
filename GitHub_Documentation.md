### ** Process to follow when working on new project ** 
## Process to follow for the first time
1. Creat an organization 
2. Assign members to the organization.
3. Assign members of the organization into teams.
## Process to follow with every new project
1. Create a repository for the project.
2. Assign team to the repository with the access permissions.
3. Create an organization project.
4. Create issues for every task within the project and assign them to the members of the team and assign them to the organization project.
5. After finishing each issue raise a pull request with issue id # and the state of the issue (fixed,close,..).
6. commit the change and push them to the main branch of the project or if you are working on a seprate branch merge it with the main branch.

#### 1. GitHub Organization
##### 1.1 About organization

- Organizations are shared accounts where businesses and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects at once, with sophisticated security and administrative features.
- Each person that uses GitHub always signs into a personal account, and multiple personal accounts can collaborate on shared projects by joining the same organization account. A subset of these personal accounts can be given the role of organization owner, which allows those people to granularly manage access to the organization's resources using sophisticated security and administrative features.
- You can invite an unlimited number of people to join your organization, then give these organization members a variety of roles that grant different levels of access to the organization and its data.
- In addition to managing access to the organization itself, you can separately manage access to your organization's repositories, project boards, and apps.
##### 1.2 Creating new organization
1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.

#### 2. GitHub Projects
##### 2.1 About projects
- A project is an adaptable spreadsheet that integrates with your issues and pull requests on GitHub to help you plan and track your work effectively. You can create and customize multiple views by filtering, sorting, grouping your issues and pull requests, adding custom fields to track metadata specific to your team, and visualize work with configurable charts. Rather than enforcing a specific methodology, a project provides flexible features you can customize to your teamâ€™s needs and processes.
- Your projects are built from the issues and pull requests you add, creating direct references between your project and your work. Information is synced automatically to your project as you make changes, updating your views and charts. This integration works both ways, so that when you change information about a pull request or issue in your project, the pull request or issue reflects that information. For example, change an assignee in your project and that change is shown in your issue. You can take this integration even further, group your project by assignee, and make changes to issue assignment by dragging issues into the different groups.

#### 3. GitHub teams
##### 3.1 About teams
1. Teams are groups of organization members that reflect your company or group's structure with cascading access permissions and mentions.
2. Organization owners and team maintainers can give teams admin, read, or write access to organization repositories. Organization members can send a notification to an entire team by mentioning the team's name. Organization members can also send a notification to an entire team by requesting a review from that team. Organization members can request reviews from specific teams with read access to the repository where the pull request is opened. Teams can be designated as owners of certain types or areas of code in a CODEOWNERS file.

##### 3.2 Creating new organization teams

#### 4. GitHub issues
##### 4.1 About teams
1. Issues let you track your work on GitHub, where development happens. When you mention an issue in another issue or pull request, the issue's timeline reflects the cross-reference so that you can keep track of related work. To indicate that work is in progress, you can link an issue to a pull request. When the pull request merges, the linked issue automatically closes.
2. You can organize and prioritize issues with projects. To track issues as part of a larger issue, you can use task lists. To categorize related issues, you can use labels and milestones.
3. To stay updated on the most recent comments in an issue, you can subscribe to an issue to receive notifications about the latest comments. 
4. You can **@mention** collaborators who have access to your repository in an issue to draw their attention to a comment. To link related issues in the same repository, you can type # followed by part of the issue title and then clicking the issue that you want to link.

##### 4.2 Creating new issues
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click  Issues.
